#question 2
#part a

My selectionsort function is stable.

The function won't swap two elements (a, b) unless it satifies the following:
1) the b is the smallest value in the rest of the array
2) a != b

By doing this, same value won't be swapped.


#part b

    cout << "stability: " << endl;
    vector<int> test3 = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
    cout << "pre: ";
    for(auto i = test3.begin(); i != test3.end(); ++i)
        cout << *i << " ";
    cout << endl ;
    
    selectionsort(test3);
    
    cout << "post: ";
    for(auto i = test3.begin(); i != test3.end(); ++i)
        cout << *i << " ";
    cout << endl ;
    
The result is that no elements were moved, which proves the selectionsort function 
is stable.
